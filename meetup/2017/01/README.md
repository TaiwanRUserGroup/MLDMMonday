      The Art of Data Storytelling

    - `Abstract`

      Forbes Magazine calls data storytelling 'the essential data science skill everyone needs'. And with good reason – well told data stories are change drivers within the modern organization. But how do we find the most important insights in our business data and communicate them in a compelling way? How do we connect the data that we have to the key underlying business issue?

      The 1 hour session will cover:

      * The essential elements of a good data story

      * Chart design and why it matters

      * Common chart design errors

      * Some before and after data story 'make overs'
