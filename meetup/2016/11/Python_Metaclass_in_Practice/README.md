# Python Metaclass in Practice

## Abstract

In this talk, I'll talk about how to use metaclass in python to do better abstraction with python codes to make it more readible and concise. I'll use a simple python package I wrote before as a demostraction and you can find the source code on my [github](https://github.com/dboyliao/pypeup). 

"In practice" means that I will start with a very simple example, such as a bunch of functions, then show you how to chaining them up to reduce repetitive, unreadible codes with the help of metaclass. Hope you will enjoy it, see you there! 

Oh, BTW, though this description is written in English, this talk will be delivered in Chinese. You're welcomed to talk to me in English afterward or send me messages. Feel free to ask me any question, I'm glad to answer your questions if I could. 


## 摘要

在這場演講裡，我會簡單地說明如何用 python 的 metaclass 去抽象化 python 程式碼，進而達到更容易閱讀與精簡的程式碼。我會用我之前寫的一個小套件當作例子，你可以從我 github 上找到[原始碼](https://github.com/dboyliao/pypeup)。 

"in practice" 意指我會從非常簡單的例子出發，例如很多很多的 function ，然後想辦法用 metaclass 將其串流進而減少重複性且不易閱讀的程式碼。希望你會喜歡。
