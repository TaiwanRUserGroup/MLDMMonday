  - ### Lightening Talk  [`slides`](https://blog.liang2.tw/2016Talk-Bioconda-UpSetR-Snakemake/) [`video`]()

    - `Title`

      An Introduction to Bioconda, UpSetR, and snakemake

    - `Abstract`

      This short talk will introduce a few interesting on-going R projects and packages in independent sections.  First section covers (Bio)conda, the package management system for both R and Python, where bioconda brings sepecific support for commonly used bioinformatic tools in both languages.  Second section introduces a R package, UpSetR, which implements a novel way to visualize intersections of sets, that is, to visualize how different groups of samples overlap with each other.  If time permits, lastly, an extended makefile-like build system, snakemake, will be demonstrated to construct a parallelized analysis pipeline involving both R and Python scripts.

    - `Title`

      Harnessing social media data with machine learning

    - `Abstract`

      Judging others' psychological traits is not only an essential skill in successful social living, but also an important factor in product development. Psychological traits are a key driver behind human interaction, behavior and emotions. Although accurate judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. It is also possible that this technique can assist clinical diagnosis in the future.
